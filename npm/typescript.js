/**
 * Typescript is a 'superset' of javascript - it does everything javascript does, and more!
 * it introduces types, interfaces, access modifiers in classes, and several new data types
 *
 * Typescript can not be run natively - it first needs to be transpiled to javascript,
 * using the 'tsc' command - that means that any types or other new features within typescript
 * only exist prior to the compilation
